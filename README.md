# tf-Faster-RCNN (work in progress)
TensorFlow implementation of Faster R-CNN, using ResNet101 as the convolutional feature extractor.

Deep models built in TensorBase, a minimalistic framework for end-to-end TensorFlow applications. Created by my good friend and collaborator Dan Salo. Check it out here: https://github.com/dancsalo/TensorBase
